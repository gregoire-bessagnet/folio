# The goal 
Creation of a single page website.

# The method and the challenge 
Using a static web publishing tool. In this case : the awesome Surge.sh 
All is done through this few lines of code. 

``` 
surge
  project: path/to/my-project
   domain: my-project.surge.sh
   upload: [============]
Success! Published and running at my-project.surge.sh
```
Unleash the magic through Surge.

# The result 
A great feeling of freedom and easiness if you allow me to use this word. Frenchie, you know.
In a more precise way : you stay focus on development. Only development.
